Let my array at 0 be "foo"
Let my array at 1 be "bar"
Let my array at 2 be "baz"
Shout my array at 0
Shout my array at 1
Shout my array at 2

The line says one two three four five
Split the line into words
The index is 0
The word is out
Until the word is nothing
Put the line at index into the word
Say the word
