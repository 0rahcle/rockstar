Your love is meaningless to me

My dreams are diamond nightmares
My soul is crying inside

Rock my dreams like a razorblade smile
Rock my soul like a switchblade missile

Rock my dreams with your love
Rock my soul with your love
Rock my dreams with your love.
Rock my soul with your love.

Shout my dreams
Shout my soul
