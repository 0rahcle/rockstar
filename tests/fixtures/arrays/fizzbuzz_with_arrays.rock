The reaper takes the fallen
Salvation is silence
Until the fallen are nothing
Roll the fallen into the fire,
Cast the fire into the dark, 
Let salvation be with the dark

Give back salvation

My dreams are diamond nightmares
Your love is meaningless to me
My soul is crying inside

Revenge is ice crystal
Hope is dead
Cast revenge without hope into oblivion

Rock my dreams like a razorblade smile
Rock my dreams with your love, your love
Rock my soul like a switchblade missile
Rock my soul with your love, your love.

Let salvation be the reaper taking my dreams
Let surrender be the reaper taking my soul

Midnight takes your heart and your soul
While your heart is as high as your soul
Put your heart without your soul into your heart

Give back your heart

Desire is a lovestruck ladykiller
My world is nothing 
Fire is ice
Hate is water
Until my world is desire,
Build my world up
If midnight taking my world, fire is nothing and midnight taking my world, hate is nothing
Shout salvation with surrender with oblivion
Take it to the top

If midnight taking my world, fire is nothing
Shout surrender with oblivion
Take it to the top

If midnight taking my world, hate is nothing
Shout salvation with oblivion
Take it to the top

Whisper my world
