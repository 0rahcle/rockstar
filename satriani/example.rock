The night takes your hopes and your fears
Your heart are loneliness
While your heart is weaker than your fears
Let the fire be your hopes with your heart
Rock the world with the fire
Build your heart up

Give back the world

The wizard is full of fear
The master says hey
The reaper says choose your index
Shout the reaper
Listen to the gates

Pick the night taking the master, and the wizard at the gates into oblivion

Shout oblivion
